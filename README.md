# SIMUL8-Simulation
A coursework piece in simulation, produced in collaboration with Georgia Mellis, Emma Tarmey, Dave Waddington, Hugh Warden and Chloe Yong

The main objective of the simulation is to model a call centre and minimise the staffing cost among the feasible solutions.
The constraints on the solutions are:
 - The trivial points that the numbers of workers must be positive integers
 - Having a Quality of Service of greater than 70%
 - Abandonment Rate of less than 5%
 
The Quality of Service is defined to be the fraction of calls whosewaiting time in queue is no larger than 30 seconds,
and the Abandonment Rateis the percentage of calls which are abandoned before they start being servedby a Call Agent.
The software used for the simulation was Simul8.
